<h2>What is Life?</h2>
<p>
A composite entity is considered alive if it is naturally assembled from chemical components and maintains its distinct organization and functionality through autonomous,
continuous interactions with its environment. Specifically, an entity is alive if it can:
</p>

<h3>Possess a Boundary:</h3>
<p>
It exhibits a defined boundary (physical and functional) that separates it from its environment. So the spatial extent has to be finite.
</p>
  
<h3>Self-Maintain and Repair:</h3>
<p>
It actively acquires, transforms, and incorporates external resources to replace any decayed or damaged components,
thereby preserving its internal structure and operational capacity. This ongoing self-maintenance defines its physical identity.
</p>
  
<h3>Retain the Potential for Renewal:</h3>
<p>
Even during periods of dormancy, the entity must possess an inherent capacity or a latent potential to resume its self-sustaining processes when conditions become favorable.
If this potential is irreversibly lost (for example, through extensive structural degradation or external corruption of essential features), then the entity is deemed as dead.
</p>
  
<h3>Optionally Reproduce:</h3>
<p>
While not strictly necessary for the basic definition of life, many living entities also have the capability to reproduce—
either by generating an independent copy as a whole or through incremental replacement of their components—thus propagating their organizational pattern.
</p>
  
<h3>May have sentience:</h3>
<p>The natural ability to percieve and be aware of the existence of the self. This can also be called as conciousness.</p>

<h2>Why Robots and AI are not alive</h2>
<p>
  Current robots fail at point 1 (self regulation is absent) and a self-regulating robot is still not naturally evolved or reproduced.<br>
  AI fails not at being natural but also not being able to learn in real time as it learns in batches and algorithms to learn do not really mimic natural nervous systems.<br>
  Not every living thing is sentient.
</p>

<h2>How I constructed this defintion and are viruses alive?</h2>
