<h2>What is Life?</h2>
<p>
A composite entity is considered alive if it is naturally assembled from chemical components and maintains its distinct organization and functionality through autonomous,
continuous interactions with its environment. Specifically, an entity is alive if it can:
</p>

<h3>1. Possess a Boundary:</h3>
<p>
It exhibits a defined boundary (physical and functional) that separates it from its environment. So the spatial extent has to be finite.
</p>
  
<h3>2. Self-Maintain and Repair:</h3>
<p>
It actively acquires, transforms, and incorporates external resources to replace any decayed or damaged components,
thereby preserving its internal structure and operational capacity. This ongoing self-maintenance defines its physical identity.
</p>
  
<h3>3. Retain the Potential for Renewal:</h3>
<p>
Even during periods of dormancy, the entity must possess an inherent capacity or a latent potential to resume its self-sustaining processes when conditions become favorable.
If this potential is irreversibly lost (for example, through extensive structural degradation or external corruption of essential features), then the entity is deemed as dead.
</p>
  
<h3>4. Optionally Reproduce:</h3>
<p>
While not strictly necessary for the basic definition of life, many living entities also have the capability to reproduce—
either by generating an independent copy as a whole or through incremental replacement of their components—thus propagating their organizational pattern.
</p>
  
<h3>5. May have sentience:</h3>
<p>The natural ability to percieve and be aware of the existence of the self. This can also be called as conciousness. Not every living thing is sentient.</p>

<h2>Why Robots and AI are not alive</h2>
<p>
  Current robots fail at point 2 (self regulation is absent) and a self-regulating robot is still not naturally evolved or reproduced.
  AI enabled self-regulating robots still fail to be alive since they are not natural but also they "learn" in batches as the algorithms to make them learn do not really mimic natural nervous systems which learn in real time.<br>
</p>

<h3>How I constructed this defintion and are viruses alive? - find below:</h3>

<h2>The Cellular Nature of Life</h2>
<p>All living organisms consist of one or more cells. The cell is the smallest functional unit of life.
A cell has a boundary called the cell membrane, which separates its interior from the external environment.
Inside the cell is a gel-like substance called the cytoplasm. The cytoplasm contains water, dissolved molecules, and cellular components called organelles that serve specific cellular functions.
The cellular functions are governed by the genetic material. Genetic material is responsible for maintaining the necessary cell processes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Metabolism</strong>: use matter from environment to survive and eject unwanted things.</li>
    <li><strong>Adaptation and response to stimuli</strong>: avoiding cell destruction from external factors up to some limits and to keep this safety information for future.</li>
    <li><strong>Reproduction</strong>: to maintain continuation of life by taking matter from outside and converting it to new optimised living matter even if the original gets destroyed.</li>
  </ul>
<p><strong>DNA</strong> and <strong>RNA</strong> strands are the unit of Genetic Material in any cell.</p>
<p><strong>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid)</strong> is a long double-helical molecule that stores genetic information and <strong>RNA (Ribonucleic Acid)</strong> is a similar single stranded molecule.</p>
<p>DNA consists of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) associated via hydrogen bonds.</p>  
<p>A (Adenine) pairs with T (Thymine) through two hydrogen bonds.
<br>C (Cytosine) pairs with G (Guanine) through three hydrogen bonds.</p>
<p>A and G are purines (larger, double-ring structures).<br>T and C are pyrimidines (smaller, single-ring structures).</p>
<p>A purine must pair with a pyrimidine to maintain a uniform distance between the two DNA strands. Pairing two purines or two pyrimidines would distort the structure of the DNA.</p>
<p>RNA is single helical unlike DNA but RNA uses Uracil (U) instead of Thymine (T).</p>
<p>A <strong>gene</strong> is a segment of DNA that contains the instructions to produce a specific protein or RNA.</p>
<p>A <strong>protein</strong> is a molecule composed of one or more chains of amino acids
(several combinations of these amino acids are possible depending on the order and folding pattern) that serves some cellular functions.
Some proteins act as enzymes as they catalyze biochemical reactions. Structural proteins provide support (e.g., collagen). Transport proteins move molecules across cell membranes.</p>

<p>Proteins are synthesized based on instructions in DNA. DNA is transcribed into mRNA (Messenger Ribonucleic Acid).
The mRNA sequence is read in triplets called codons, where each codon corresponds to a specific amino acid. Earthlings have 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 codons.
61 codons code for the 20 amino acids (some amino acids are coded by multiple codons—this is called "degeneracy" of the genetic code).
Out of these 61, one can act as start codon (mostly AUG) and the remaining 3 codons are stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA), which signal the termination of protein synthesis.
RNA is translated into a sequence of amino acids to form a protein.</p>

<p>DNA is organized into structures called <strong>chromosomes</strong>. Chromosomes are long strands of DNA coiled around proteins called <strong>histones</strong>.
Histones help condense DNA into a compact, organized form. Each chromosome contains <strong>telomeres</strong> at its ends.
Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences that protect chromosomes from damage during replication.</p>
<p>A <strong>locus</strong> is the specific position of a gene on a chromosome. An <strong>allele</strong> is a variant form of a gene found at the same locus on a chromosome.
The <strong>genotype</strong> is the complete set of genes (alleles) of an organism. The genotype determines the genetic potential of an organism (what traits it can potentially show).
The maximum number of theoretical alleles for a gene of length <em>n</em> nucleotides is 4<sup>n</sup>.</p>
<p>The <strong>genome</strong> of an organism is the totality of all genes.</p>

<p>The <strong>phenotype</strong> is the observable traits or characteristics of an organism. The phenotype results from the interaction between the genotype and the environment.
If the phenotype is not fit for the environment then the organism dies and only the fit ones survive that have the fit alleles to pass onto the next generation (natural selection).
A <strong>karyotype</strong> is the ordered display of an organism's chromosomes.
<p>Genes do not decide the traits by themselves but environments affect what proteins will be synthesised through them.</p>

<p><strong>Genetic mutations</strong> are the random (internally and rarely) or externally influenced (mostly) changes in the sequence of nucleotides (the building blocks of DNA) that make up a gene.
These mutations lead to genetic diseases or beneficial adaptations.</p>

<h3>Types of Cells</h3>
<p><strong>Eukaryotic cells</strong> contain a nucleus that encloses the genetic material in multiple chromosomes. Their genome is the total of genes from the nucleus and the mitochondria.</p>
<p><strong>Prokaryotic cells</strong> are simple and lack a nucleus. Genes are typically located in a single circular chromosome,
which is found in the nucleoid region of the cell (not enclosed in a nucleus, unlike in eukaryotes).
In addition to the main chromosome, prokaryotes may also contain smaller, circular pieces of DNA called <strong>plasmids</strong>, which can carry additional genes,
often for traits like antibiotic resistance. Prokaryotic genes code for proteins and are involved in processes such as replication, transcription, and translation, similar to eukaryotic organisms,
but often simpler and more direct.</p>
  
<h3>Viruses</h3>
<p>A <strong>virus</strong> is a parasitic living (based on the defintion I suggested above) being composed of genetic material (DNA or RNA, not both) enclosed in a protein coat called a <strong>capsid</strong>.
A virus lacks cellular structure and cannot replicate independently. Viruses infect host cells to reproduce, using the host's cellular machinery.</p>

<h3>How Life on Earth Began and Evolved</h3>
<p>
Life originated on Earth when specific molecules accidentally organized themselves into complex structures under the right conditions. The first key molecule was <strong>RNA</strong>,
which formed naturally. Some of these RNA molecules became trapped in lipid bubbles floating in water, which contained fatty acids—these structures are known as <strong>protocells</strong>.
</p>
<p>
All known <strong>prokaryotic cells</strong> are classified as either <strong>Bacteria</strong> or <strong>Archaea</strong>. These are simple cells without a nucleus.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Eukaryotic cells</strong> evolved later through a process called <em>endosymbiosis</em>, where one prokaryotic cell (a bacterium) invaded another (an archaeon).
Instead of destroying it, the invading bacterium became part of the host, eventually evolving into an organelle called the <strong>mitochondrion</strong>,
which has its own genetic material separate from the nucleus. Mitochondria provide energy through metabolism and are often referred to as the <em>powerhouse</em> of the cell,
enabling the development of more complex, multicellular organisms.
</p>
<p>
Thus, life on Earth began through a natural, non-living process called <strong>abiogenesis</strong> and evolved over time through <strong>natural selection</strong>.
Natural selection is the process by which organisms better adapted to their environments are more likely to survive and reproduce.
Those that can reproduce pass on their traits, making their lineage "fit" for the environment. Lineages that cannot adapt eventually die out.
</p>

<p>Hence, based on the basic understanding of how life has originated, evolved and functions at the fundamental level, I came up with my definition of "alive".</p>
