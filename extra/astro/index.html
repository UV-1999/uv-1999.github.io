Astronomy/Astrophysics is the science of astronomical objects (objects beyond the atmosphere of the Earth i.e. in the outer space).
The universe/cosmos is hence outer space and the Earth combined.
The information about any astronomical object is derived from the radiation coming from it.
Radiation simply means the outflow of energy-momentum, it can either be in the form of travelling waves (waves are energy-momentum propagating in a medium.
In contrast, standing waves are confined and hence cannot be a type of radiation) or matter particles (objects for which the size is negligible compared to the extent of their motion).
We gather radiation in the following three ways: electromagnetic (EM) radiation, cosmic radiation (neutrinos and other subatomic particles), and gravitational radiation.
These three ways are the kinds of astronomical signals we observe, record and analyse.
We call them as signal since they carry information about the source they are originated from, as well as the effects they suffer while being radiated.
Signal and noise donâ€™t have a generalised consistent definition. In a particular case, what we want becomes the signal and what we don't want becomes the noise.
From now I focus on EM radiation.

<h2>Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
<p>
The Maxwell equations in vacuum lead to the wave equation for electric and magnetic fields.
The wave equation is a linear second-order partial differential equation.
The general solutions can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoidal (harmonic) solutions.
Fourier analysis is a mathematical tool that decomposes functions (like an EM field in space or time) into sums or integrals of sines and cosines.
Since the wave equation supports each sine/cosine function as a valid solution, any arbitrary EM wave can be represented as a linear combination of these sinusoidal components.
Every sinusoidal component of an EM wave is a transverse wave (the direction in which electric and magnetic field oscillates is perpendicular to the direction of propagation).
EM waves have a specific polarisation state, duration and bandwidth (range of wavelengths/frequencies over which sinusoids add to form the wave pattern).

The wavelength can change depending on the medium in which the radiation is traveling through (because speed changes), but the frequency remains fixed.
EM waves are generated when the charge and current distributions vary in time.
These waves interact with charged particles, but also affect neutral objects composed of charged particles.
In classical physics, this happens when charged particles accelerate.
In quantum physics, this happens when charged particles change their quantised energy states.
The quantum particle associated with EM waves is called photon and the journey of a photon starts with emission, disturbed by scattering, and ends with absorption.
The absorption is called detection or observation when it happens at a detector.
