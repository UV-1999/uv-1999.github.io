Astronomy/Astrophysics is the science of astronomical objects (objects beyond the atmosphere of the Earth i.e. in the outer space).
The universe/cosmos is hence outer space and the Earth combined.
The information about any astronomical object is derived from the radiation coming from it.
Radiation simply means the outflow of energy-momentum, it can either be in the form of travelling waves (waves are energy-momentum propagating in a medium.
In contrast, standing waves are confined and hence cannot be a type of radiation) or matter particles (objects for which the size is negligible compared to the extent of their motion).
We gather radiation in the following three ways: electromagnetic (EM) radiation, cosmic radiation (neutrinos and other subatomic particles), and gravitational radiation.
These three ways are the kinds of astronomical signals we observe, record and analyse.
They are also types of signals since they carry information about the source they are originated from, as well as the effects they suffer while being radiated.
Signal and noise don’t have a generalised consistent definition. In a particular case, what we want becomes the signal and what we don't want becomes the noise.
From now I focus on EM radiation.
</p>

<h2>Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>
<p>
EM radiation is propagating EM wave which is a combination of waves in both electric and magnetic fields.
EM fields exists when electric charges and currents exists. Therefore EM waves are generated when the electric charge and current distributions vary in time.
The Maxwell equations in vacuum lead to the wave equation for electric and magnetic fields.
These wave equations are linear second-order partial differential equations.
The general solutions can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoidal (harmonic) solutions.
Fourier analysis is a mathematical tool that decomposes functions (like an EM field in space or time) into sums or integrals of sines and cosines.
Since the wave equation supports each sine/cosine function as a valid solution, therefore any arbitrary EM wave can be represented as a linear combination of these sinusoidal components.
Every sinusoidal component of an EM wave is a transverse wave (the direction in which electric and magnetic field oscillates is perpendicular to the direction of propagation).
EM waves have a specific polarisation state (direction in which the wave's electric field vectors oscillate),
emission timescale (the time it takes for EM wave to generate which is linked with the timescales over which charge or current distributions vary)
and bandwidth (range of wavelengths/frequencies over which sinusoids add to form the emitted wave pattern).
The time–frequency uncertainty principle says that the duration and bandwidth of any EM wave are inversely proportional to each other.
Slow changes in charge or current distributions produce narrowband EM waves. Fast or abrupt changes produce broadband EM waves.
Only an infinitely slow emission process (charges or currents oscillating smoothly) can make EM waves of precisely single frequency.
In contrast, A fast process create pulses but they are broadband.
</p>

<p>
EM waves fundamentally interact with charged particles hence also affect neutral objects composed of charged particles.
In classical physics, EM waves are created when charged particles accelerate.
In quantum physics, they are created when charged particles change their quantised energy states. For example, in case of molecular, atomic and nuclear transitions.
The quantum particle associated with EM waves is called photon and the journey of a photon starts with its emission, disturbed by scattering events, and ends with its absorption.
Absorption is called detection or observation when it happens at a detector.
</p>

<h2>Quantification of Radiation</h2>
<p>
To understand how radiation is emitted, scattered and absorbed which we can call collectively as transportion of radiation.
First we must realise that radiation is propagating energy-momentum so for a specific polarisation state, one can talk about the following parameters:
Energy, Direction, Position, Time, Frequency/wavelength, Area from which the radiation is being emitted or being collected/detected.
</p>

<p>
Specifically in astronomy and astrophysics, radiated energy per unit time is called as luminosity, radiant flux, or radiant power.
Energy per unit time per unit detector area is called flux density. Energy per unit time per unit detector area per unit solid angle is called intensity.
Putting spectral or specific before a physical quantity means per unit frequency or wavelength. Spectral intensity is an important quantity here.
It is the radiated power collected on unit detector area coming from a specific direction (unit solid angle) which makes it flux density along a specific ray path at a particular observation frequency.
Hence it is distant independent and stays constant along the ray path if radiation travels in empty space.
Any change in spectral intensity is only possible if along the path there are emission, absorption and scattering events.
The following table summarises electronic transitions that result in emission, absorption and scattering events:

      <td>Although a free electron cannot absorb a photon completely since the energy can be conserved but not the momentum, but
      in presenece of a third body to conserve momentum it is possible and it will be broadband.</td>
      <td>Bremsstrahlung radiation (broadband). Free electron need a third body in its vicinity to conserve momentum.</td>
      <td>Thomson (elastic and narrowband), Compton (photons lose energy) and inverse (photons gain energy) Compton scattering (inelastic and broadband)</td>
