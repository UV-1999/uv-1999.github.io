<h2>Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>

<p>
Astronomy/Astrophysics is the science of astronomical objects (objects beyond the atmosphere of the Earth i.e. in the outer space).
The universe/cosmos is the outer space and the Earth combined.
The information about any astronomical object is derived from the radiation coming from it.
Radiation simply means the outflow of energy-momentum, it can either be in the form of travelling waves (waves are energy-momentum propagating in a medium.
In contrast, standing waves are confined and hence cannot be a type of radiation) or matter particles (objects for which the size is negligible compared to the extent of their motion).
</p>

<p>
We gather radiation in the following three ways: electromagnetic (EM) radiation, cosmic radiation (neutrinos and other subatomic particles), and gravitational radiation.
These three ways are the types of astronomical radiation we observe, record and analyse.
They are called signals since they carry information about the source they are originated from, as well as the effects they suffer while being radiated.
Part of the data that does not carry information of the souce is called noise.
From now onwards, I focus only on EM radiation.
</p>

<h2>Electromagnetic Radiation</h2>

<p>
EM radiation is propagating EM wave which is a combination of waves in both electric and magnetic fields.
EM fields exists when electric charges and currents exists. Therefore EM waves are generated when the electric charge or current distributions vary in time.
The Maxwell's equations in vacuum lead to the wave equation for electric and magnetic fields.
These wave equations are linear second-order partial differential equations.
The general solutions can be expressed as a superposition of sinusoidal (harmonic) solutions.
Fourier analysis is a mathematical tool that decomposes functions (like an EM field in space or time) into sums or integrals of sines and cosines of different amplitudes, frequencies and phases.
Since the wave equation supports each sine/cosine function as a valid solution, therefore any arbitrary EM wave can be represented as a linear combination of these sinusoidal components.
Every sinusoidal component of an EM wave is a transverse wave (the direction in which electric and magnetic field oscillates is perpendicular to the direction of propagation).
</p>

<p>
EM waves have a specific polarisation state (direction in which the wave's electric field vectors oscillate),
emission timescale (the time it takes for EM wave to generate which is linked with the timescales over which charge or current distributions vary)
and bandwidth (range of wavelengths/frequencies over which sinusoids add to form the emitted wave pattern).
The timeâ€“frequency uncertainty principle says that the emission timescale and the bandwidth of any EM wave are inversely proportional to each other.
Slow changes in charge or current distributions produce narrowband EM waves. Fast or abrupt changes produce broadband EM waves.
Only an infinitely slow emission process (charges or currents oscillating smoothly) can make EM waves of precisely single frequency.
In contrast, A fast process create pulses but they are broadband. For example, X-rays and gamma rays overlap in frequency but differ by origin.
X-rays arise from atomic electron transitions and gamma rays arise from nuclear transitions.
This origin difference reflects in the emission timescale: electrons have shorter excited-state lifetimes, yielding broader spectral lines,
while nuclei have longer excited-state lifetimes, producing narrower lines, even at similar photon energies.
</p>

<p>
EM waves fundamentally interact with charged particles hence also affect neutral objects composed of charged particles.
In classical physics, EM waves are created when charged particles accelerate.
In quantum physics, they are created when charged particles change their quantised energy states. For example, in case of molecular, atomic and nuclear transitions.
The quantum particle associated with EM waves is called photon and the journey of a photon starts with its emission, disturbed by scattering events, and ends with its absorption.
Absorption is called detection or observation when it happens at a detector. Whenever an EM wave is travelling through a material medium,
the oscillating electric and magnetic fields induces motion of free charges in that medium which results in a secondary EM wave as a reaction
and as it interferes with the original, it disturbes its phase ultimately causing the wave to suffer scattering and absorption.
The wavelength can change depending on the medium in which the radiation is traveling through (because speed changes), but the frequency remains fixed.
</p>

<h2>Quantification of Radiation</h2>
<p>
To understand how radiation is emitted, scattered and absorbed which we can call collectively as transportion of radiation.
First we must realise that radiation is propagating energy-momentum so for a specific polarisation state, one can talk about the following parameters:
Energy, Direction, Position, Time, Frequency/wavelength, and the Area from which the radiation is being emitted or being collected/detected.
</p>

<p>
Specifically in astronomy and astrophysics, radiated energy per unit time is called as luminosity, radiant flux, or radiant power.
Energy per unit time per unit detector area is called flux density. Energy per unit time per unit detector area per unit solid angle is called intensity.
Putting spectral or specific before a physical quantity means per unit frequency or wavelength. Spectral intensity is an important quantity here.
It is the radiated power collected on unit detector area coming from a specific direction (unit solid angle) which makes it "flux density along a specific ray path at a particular observation frequency".
Hence it is distant independent and stays constant along the ray path if radiation travels in empty space (no scattering or absorption).
Any change in spectral intensity is only possible if along the path there are emission, absorption and scattering events.
</p>

<p>
Consider that astronomical observations (specifically electromagnetic)
are the records of how radiation field evolve with time at different wave frequencies.
What any detector really measure is flux density which is power per unit area per unit time over a small range of frequencies and direction.
We can have extremely high frequency and angular resolution yet it is not a direct measurement of spectral intensity.
To really understand how the observed radiation evolved in its path towards the detector,
we come up with models and then infer the spectral intensity (which is function of time and position hence a scalar field), then compute the flux density to match it with observational data.
Observed flux density as a function of time is called the Light-curve of any astronomical source.
Observed flux density as a function of frequency or wavelength is called the spectrum.
The combined thing (Observed flux density as function of both time and frequency/wavelength) is called the dynamic spectrum.
The program of astrophysics is therefore to infer physical properties of the source from its observed radiation.
Astronomical sources evolve in time, if the timescales over which any significant change happens is far larger than the human timescales (centuries or more),
then to understand the whole process, astronomers use a population study: we compare many different sources at different stages. A prime example for this is stellar evolution.
But if the timescales are shorter the human timescales (decades, years, days or less) then the source has to be observed with sufficient cadence (number of times you observe the same source).
</p>

<p>
We now focus over physics of radiation and attempt to summarise different cases.
The following table summarises electronic transitions that result in emission, absorption and scattering events:

      <td>Bremsstrahlung radiation (broadband). Free electron need a third body in its vicinity to conserve momentum.</td>

<h2>
Thermal Radiation and Coherence
</h2>
<p>
Majorly all astronomical source are composed of dust, gas and plasma.
In general, radiation from these astrophysical matter is either broadband or narrowband.
If radiation is broadband then it can be thermal hence incoherent.
If radiation is broadband but non-thermal then it can be either coherent or incoherent.
If radiation is narrowband then it is always non-thermal but still can be either coherent or incoherent.
Coherence means that the radiated waves from different emitters are phase-correlated.
If two signals are coherent, their peaks, troughs, and shapes stay in sync or follow a consistent pattern without drifting apart unpredictably.
Thermal radiation is a combination of line, recombination and free-free radiation which orignates from random thermal motion of emitters hence it cannot be coherent.
