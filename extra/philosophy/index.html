<h2>What is Philosophy?</h2>
<p>
Philosophy is the systematic inquiry into all things, which are of two kinds: entities and ideas.
Entities exist independently of any mind.
A mind is that which can form ideas.
Ideas are abstractions that depend on minds to be formed.
An entity is said to exist if it is instantiated in reality.
Reality is the totality of all entities.
The world is the totality of all things.
The abstract world is the totality of all ideas.
Ideas can be objective in the sense that different minds can form the same ideas, but they do not exist independently of minds.
</p>
<p>
Philosophical inquiry is carried out by philosophical agents.
An agent is an entity that can bring about effects in the real world.
A philosophical agent is an agent that can form ideas about things, their properties, and relations between them.
Properties are abstract things that describe or characterize other things.
Relations are descriptions of interactions or connections between two or more things.
From now on, philosophical agents are called agents for brevity.
Objects are entities other than agents.
</p>
<p>
All agents observed so far are living entities. They are alive.
To understand philosophical agents, we must first define life, then describe how experience and reasoning arise, and finally relate this to things.
</p>
<p>
A composite entity is alive if it is naturally assembled and maintains its organization and functionality through continuous interactions with its environment.
It must have a definite boundary separating it from its environment.
It must acquire, transform, and incorporate external resources to replace decayed or damaged components, thereby preserving its internal structure and operational capacity.
This ongoing self-maintenance defines its physical identity.
Even during dormancy, the entity must have a latent potential to resume self-sustaining processes when conditions allow.
If this potential is irreversibly lost, the entity is dead.
While reproduction is not strictly necessary for life, living entities typically have the capacity to reproduce either by generating independent copies or by replacing components incrementally.
For a living entity to be a philosophical agent, it must be sentient.
Sentience is the natural ability to perceive and model the existence of the self. Not every living entity is sentient.
Sentience requires mechanisms to process inputs from the environment, store information, and form ideas based on this information.
Reasoning is the capacity to examine and relate ideas to each other. Experience is the continuous formation and updating of ideas based on interaction with the environment.
An agent can sense its environment and then form ideas about the existence, properties, and relations of things, including itself.
</p>
  
<h2>Beliefs and Epistemology</h2>
<p>
Experience and reasoning are processes through which an agent forms beliefs.
A belief is an idea held by an agent about a thing, its properties, or relations.
</p>
<p>
A belief is qualified to be true or be called a truth in either of the two independent ways:
<br><br>
1. Coherence (a priori, reasoned truth) - A belief is coherent if it is inferred from other beliefs without contradiction.
Inference is the process by which an agent forms new beliefs from existing ones.
To contradict is to imply that a belief is false.
Beliefs are coherent only when they do not contradict themselves or other held truths.
<br><br>
2. Correspondence (a posteriori, empirical truth) -
A belief corresponds to reality if it accurately describes an entity as it exists (facts).
Beliefs that fail to correspond are false.
Coherence alone does not guarantee correspondence; justification is required.
</p>
  
<p>
Knowledge is belief that is justified (demonstrated or proven to be true).
Epistemology (theory of knowledge) is the study of justification of beliefs.
The goal of epistemology is to decide what beliefs are regarded as knowledge.
</p>

<p>
Epistemology is hence the branch of philosophy that focuses over what and how an agent can know about anything
either by experience (a posteriori) or by reasoning alone (a priori).
</p>

<p>
A posteriori knowledge - Beliefs that are conceived through experience and justified to be true only by observation or an empirical evidence.
These are correspondent truths.
</p>

<p>
A priori knowledge - Beliefs that are conceived through reason and justified to be true without any need of observation or an empirical evidence.
These are coherent truths.
</p>

<h2>Reason and Logic</h2>

<p>
The branch of philosophy that studies coherent reasoning is called Logic.
The goal of logic is to define the coherent rules of inference so that an agent can construct coherent beliefs.
Coherent reasoning is important because it is a necessary requirement for the beliefs to hold any meaningful description.
This requirement of coherency in logic is called the principle of non-contradiction.
As long as we presuppose this principle, our inferred beliefs are coherent.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle" target="_blank">Aristotle</a>
showed that if we assume that a belief can be both true and false at the same time
then this assumption itself can be both true and false at the same time.
This assumption therefore contradicts itself, implying its own negation, where any belief cannot be both true and false at the same time.
Which finally affirms that principle of non-contradiction.
It is important to note that this principle does not forbid the truth value of a belief to be unknown. 
An agent may not know the truth value yet but the belief cannot be true and false both at the same time.
</p>

<p>
Logic requires a system called language to express and organize beliefs.
A belief expressed in some language is called a proposition.
In a proposition, the subject is the description of a thing and the predicate is the description of properties of that thing.
Based on the contents of a proposition, there are two kinds: Analytic and Synthetic.
</p>


<h3>Analytic Propositions</h3>

<p>
In these propositions the predicate is the definition of the subject. They are a priori as they do not require any empirical evidence.
They do not necessarily conform to reality but are true because the definitive properties must not contradict each other (coherent truth). Examples:<br>
1. “A quadrilateral has four sides.” (Quadrilaterals are defined as planar shapes which have four sides.)<br>
2. “A sister is a female sibling.” ("Female siblings" and "sisters" are literally the same thing.)
</p>

<h3>Synthetic Propositions</h3>

<p>
In these propositions the predicate is not the definition of the subject, where properties other than definitive properties are claimed.
They are contingent either on reason or observation:
</p>    

<h3>Synthetic A posteriori</h3>

<p>
Without using any sensory information or inferential experiment, the truth value of these claims cannot be decided. Hence they are true only by conforming to reality. Examples:<br>
1. “It is raining."<br>
2. “The molecular structure of pure water is H<sub>2</sub>O.”
</p>

<p>
Some synthetic a posteriori propositions can have subjects that are not precisely defined but rather stay as a cluster of properties. e.g. "Dogs are domesticated wolves."
In this sentence, a property of dogs is talked about but the subject "Dog" does not have a precise definition.
Hence a subject can be defined based on identifying several properties of the corresponding entity and using a name for it. 
</p>

<h3>Synthetic A priori</h3>

<p>
Consider the proposition: "There is a hippopotamus in this matchbox."
I can try to observe it but cannot find it, and then it can be argued that it is hidden because the inability to observe the hidden hippo does not make the claim false.
But one can take the definition of a hippopotamus and a matchbox and reason that it is bigger than a matchbox, so it cannot be in this matchbox. Without observing a hippo,
we can say that the claim is false.
In a way, we claimed that “A hippo cannot be in a matchbox” to be true, which is synthetic but not a posteriori.
</p>

<p>
Synthetic A priori claims do not require direct experience or observation to be true. “For a triangle, the sum of the angles is 180 degrees.”
This is not the definition of a triangle but it is still true without any direct observation.
However, it is impossible to prove the angle sum property of triangles without having the notion of angles, points, lines and space.
All synthetic a priori claims are true in their conceptual framework, so the cases where the conceptual framework does not work, the synthetic a priori claims do not work also.
For example, the angle sum property is true for triangles in Euclidean geometry only.
</p>

<h2>Philosophical Arguments</h2>

<p>
The initial beliefs from where reasoning starts are called premises and the inferred beliefs are called conclusions.
An argument is a set of premises that justifies a conclusion. Hence arguments are a formal usage of reasoning to establish knowledge.
</p>

<p>
An argument is called deductive if the conclusion is already included in the premises but may not be obvious to an agent.
Hence deductive argument "deduct" the required conclusion from the premises. They guarantee the truth of conclusion if the premises are true.
Deductive arguments are useful in generating a priori knowledge.
</p>

<p>
If the premises being true guarantees the conclusion also being true then the argument is called as a valid argument.
Moreover if the premises are true then such a valid argument is called a sound argument, otherwise it is called an unsound argument.
Invalid arguments do not guarantee the truth of conclusion hence are also called as deductive fallacies.
</p>

<p>
An argument is called ampliative if the conclusions are not deduced from the premises but rather involve new beliefs.
Ampliative arguments are useful in generating a posteriori knowledge.
A non-deductive or ampliative argument is of two types: Abductive and Inductive.
</p>

<p>

</tr>
</table>
</div>

<p>
Only deductive argument guarantees the truth of the conclusion.
Abductive and inductive arguments are trial fits to make the deduction work.
The idea of non-deductive or ampliative arguments introduces the concept of probability (how likely the conclusion is).
The probable the conclusions, the stronger the ampliative argument.
If the premises are in fact true then such strong arguments are called cogent arguments.
</p>

<p>
In abduction, we seek a probable case that makes the conclusion deductively true given the rule is true.
</p>

<p>
In induction, we seek a probable rule that makes the conclusion deductively true given the case is true.
</p>

<p>
In a way, abduction is about finding what probably happened (finding the case that fits the rule), and induction is about what probably will happen (as the rule dictates it).
Deduction is finding what happens.
</p>

<p>
Relative to a deductive conclusion, the premises and argument involved are called its proof. For any synthetic a priori proposition, a proof can be demanded.
Based on how we proceed to supply proofs, we find the following problem:
</p>

<h2>Münchhausen Trilemma</h2>

<p>
There are only three ways of absolutely completing an argument:<br>
1. The circular argument - in which the proof of some proposition presupposes the truth of that very proposition.
The problem is that it is not an argument but rather some elaborate rephrasing of the proposition to be proven as its proof.<br>
2. The regressive argument - in which each proof requires a further proof, and so on.
The problem is here the unending nature of such arguments. It is commonly described as the unending "why?" questionnaire.<br>
3. The dogmatic argument - which rests on accepted propositions that are merely asserted rather than proven. Hence simply rejects to be an argument at all.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper" target="_blank">Popper</a> suggested that one must
accept this trilemma as unsolvable and construct knowledge by the method of conjecture and criticism.
</p>

<h2>Axiology, Aesthetics, and Ethics</h2>

<p>
But why an agent holds any belief and bother about arguments and justifications? The motivation to hold any belief is decided from the agent's values.
Values are principles or standards (specific form of beliefs) that specify what is considered worthwhile or desirable. Axiology is the branch of philosophy that studies values.
Values are of two types: moral and non-moral.
</p>

<p>  
Non-moral values are values that involve permissible actions.
Moral values are values that involve obligatory and forbidden actions.
Ethics is the study of moral values and aesthetics is the study of non-moral values. 
</p>

<p>  
Moral agents are agents that can make choices based on what moral values they hold.
Ethics is hence the study of an agent’s moral choices.
In ethics, the goal is to find the right moral choices (what an agent is ought to do).
Moral choices can only be made when the agent is able to make any choice.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant" target="_blank">Kant</a> described this fact as "Ought implies can."
Which means "If you are ought to do it then first you must be able to do it."
Hence studying the agents themselves is the key of any axiological study.
</p>

<p>
Ethics is contingent on choices (actions) and the ability to experience (suffering and pleasure).
Choice and experience are linked via reasoning. Reasoning converts experiences into beliefs and to chosen actions.
But Choice, Reason and Experience are the fundamental aspects of sentient consciousness and
ultimately contingent on the problem of how it emerges out of unconscious components (the Hard Problem of Consciousness).
This is how axiology is contingent on epistemology and logic and that being contingent on metaphysics.
Analogous to how I called metaphysics as low-level philosophy, axiology can be comparatively called as high-level philosophy since
here the focus is not on the fundamental nature of things but rather on attitude of any agent towards any belief.
</p>

<p>
Aesthetic and ethical values often overlap, blurring their boundaries.
Humans cannot make coherent, context-sensitive judgement all the time in every situation hence humans tend to build coherent value systems by reflection, decision, and correction.
</p>
  
<h2>Science and Research</h2>

<p>
Coming back to the Münchhausen Trilemma, the process of conjecture and criticism, suggested by Popper, underlies the methodological core of science.
Science is a specialised method of philosophical inquiry under specific constraints called as the "scientific method".
The goal of science is to create a description of any system (the part of world that is being studied) by establishing its properties and the relations among its properties by reason, experience or both.
At any instant such a description is called a scientific theory. Scientific knowledge can hence be defined as coherent true beliefs which withstand repeated scrutiny and revision.
The apparently non-scientific fields like humanities and social studies (law, politics, history, etc.) do contain features of the scientific method since the goal is still to describe and make inferences.
Depending on the system, scientific studies are of two types: empirical and formal.
</p>

<h3>Formal Science</h3>

<p>
Formal sciences involve developing theories of abstract systems that may model some general or idealised features of real world or natural systems.
The axioms (fundamental premises that are assumed to be true) are set in such a way that the deductions lead to useful or
at least interesting results (theorems) that are universal in application and deductively valid.
Logic, Statistics, Computer Science are all examples of formal science.
Hence formal scientific theories are exact relative to their axioms and can be revised when axioms are changed or reinterpreted.
Theorems are the propositions deduced from axioms or already deduced theorems. The argument presented to verify the deduction of a theorem is called proof of that theorem.
The systematic study of the deductive consequences of axioms within formal systems is called Mathematics.
Mathematics provides the general framework, and formal sciences instantiate it in domain-specific ways.
A system of axioms is called:
</p>

<p>
Complete: if every true theorem must have a proof then the system of axioms is complete.<br><br>
Incomplete: If you can't prove some theorem to be true or false using some system of axioms, then that system of axioms is incomplete.<br><br>
Decidable: if some algorithm (standard method) must exist so that whether the statement has followed from an axiom can be checked then the system is decidable.<br><br>
Consistent: If it is free of contradiction. Being able to prove something but not its opposite (not converse but inverse).
Basically if I can prove some statements to be true from my axioms, I should not be able to prove the same statement to be false, otherwise my system of axioms is inconsistent.
</p>

<p>
In classical logic, where every proposition is either true or false (sometimes called as the law of excluded middle), every inconsistent system of axioms is trivially complete.
This means such an inconsistent system can prove both a theorem and its negation, and by the principle of explosion, it can prove any proposition to be true or false.
Because of this “garbage in, garbage out” effect, a useful axiomatic system must be consistent. While it may not be complete, consistency is essential for the system to be meaningful and useful.
</p>  

<h3>Empirical Science</h3>

<p>
In the case of empirical sciences, (where the system is a part of reality. For example: Physics, Biology, Social Science, etc.)
the theory does not "exactly" describe the system but a model of the system which is an approximation of it.
In empirical sciences, every observation of a system may give us a posteriori knowledge of some properties of the system.
The model has to be developed such that it explains all the known properties.
But such a model is not complete; it has to predict new observable properties.
If such predictions are observed then such observations become an evidence for the theory.
If observations are contrary to the predictions then the theory is revised or discarded. This feature of theories in empirical sciences is called falsifiability.
Falsification enables us to test if the theory is empirical in nature or not. This process has to be repeated in the search of finer theories and this process is called scientific research.
</p>

<p>
<b>The metaphysical basis of empirical science</b><br>
Empirical science begins with the description of events. All observations are ultimately observations of events.
An event is a change from one physical state to another. Events presuppose change.
Change implies a difference between states: something is not the same at one time as it is at another or we can say that something happens at a particular place and time.
This necessarily entails time, space, and material undergoing motion or transformation. A physical state is defined by material configuration in space at a time.
An event is characterized by three fundamental questions: What happens, Where, and When. This defines the fundamental program of scientific observations.
Theoretical science then try to construct models to answer the previous ones and also an extra question: How events occur which is tested with scientific experiments.
</p>

<p>
The most basic observable change is the change in position over time called motion.
Motion is thus the minimal empirical content of reality. Mechanics, the study of motion, forms the foundation of physics.
Without motion, there are no events to explain; without mechanics, physics does not begin.
</p>

<p>
Hence empirical science implicitly presupposes the following metaphysical properties:
<ol>
  <li>Materiality: Physical systems consist of material, which is the subject of change.</li>
  <li>Spatiality: Material exists and is localized in space.</li>
  <li>Temporality: Events occur in time, and time implies ordering or a direction of happening.</li>
</ol>
</p>
  
<h3>Observations in Empirical Science</h3>

<p>
<b>How do observations of a system give us knowledge of its properties?</b><br>
Observations are possible because we possess the ability to sense our environment. The raw outcomes of these senses form the experience.
Measurement is the process of transforming observations into objective, recordable and communicable description of any property of a system. A measured property is a constructed predicate:
a label we use to describe certain aspects of a system that consistently correlate with our sensory experiences. These labels gain meaning through interaction and comparison.
Every measured property is hence a record of a sensible effect arising from interaction of the observer with the system. Because of these interactions, measurements are inherently comparative.
Measurement is either categorical or numerical. Unlike categorical measurements (assigning a category value to a measurement),
in numerical measurements we have to define reference values to standardize measurements. These reference values are called units.
</p>

<p>
<b>What is a relevant observational evidence?</b><br>
You may easily remember that a priori propositions are either definitions or deductions, but a posteriori propositions come with the need for observational evidence to justify them.
For example, the proposition "420 is an even number" is a synthetic a priori proposition, and if you know the definitions of "420" and "even number," deducing the truth of the proposition 
is not very difficult. Now consider "All ravens are black." The claim is clearly a posteriori and impossible to justify as a formal proof
but rather can only be accepted as a provisional truth unless falsified by observing a non-black raven.
</p>

<p>
But a paradox arises under the framework of classical logic: Since "All raves are black" can be rephrased as "If something is raven then it must be black"
therefore by contraposition rule in classical logic, it is equivalent to "If something is non black then it must be non-raven".
This equivalence holds because classical logic equates propositions solely based on their truth values irrespective of the contents of the propositions.
While a black-raven is a proper direct evidence in support of the claim "All ravens are black", something like a red robin or green lantern is direct
an evidence to "If something is non black then it must be non-raven". This makes a red robin or anything non-black and non-raven allegedly an evidence for "All ravens are black".
This is the raven paradox.
</p>
<p>
Keeping in mind that bad results often come from bad assumptions, it is reasonable to doubt the usage of classical logic here.
Empirical sciences in which propositions are often synthetic a posteriori, require an evidence based reasoning which classical logic cannot handle.
In classical logic, because of the assumed law of excluded middle, propositions like "Either there is a black raven or there isn’t" is valid even if you’ve never seen a raven.
Inference in classical logic operates by assuming a proposition either true or false and then checking the validity of any compound proposition.
In constructive logic, instead of the law of excluded middle, the truth values of propositions are based on proofs (for a priori propositions) and evidences (for empirical propositions).
Hence the contraposition rule does not apply and no raven paradox arises in constructive logic. Any claim regarding a raven requires an evidence that ravens exists first.
While we cannot provide an absolute evidence for a claim like "All ravens are black", we can still conclude that a red robin is not a relevant evidence for the claim.
It is worth noting that every proposition provable constructively is also valid classically.
But not all classically valid propositions are provable constructively.
</p>

<p>
<b>How to have trust in measurements?</b><br>
The result of an experiment may have several measurements and it becomes naturally crucial to describe the quality of a measurement.
To quantify the quality of any measurement we must report both the best estimate and the uncertainty about it.
</p>

<p>
Precision is the degree of agreement or consistency (reproducibility) among multiple measurements of the same property.
Lack of precision is termed as uncertainty and numerically it is the degree of the spread of values we measured for a given property.
More is the precision less is the uncertainty and vice versa.</p>

<p>
An instrument measures a property numerically. Let’s say it shows 010.1040. Since here the 0 (left to 1 before decimal) is not a significant digit, we safely re-write it to be 10.1040.
Why are we keeping the rightmost 0? Because it is significant. It is obvious that non-zero digits are significant but the significance of zeros between nonzero digits and
trailing zeros have a little more for us to understand.
These zeros are telling us that there is 0 contribution of that particular digit place (power of 10) and having such shows the finest possible measurement that can be made with that instrument,
often called the least count which also serves as a measure of precision for the instrument.
For the above example, the least count is 0.0001 because the measurement is possible up to the fourth decimal place. 
</p>

<p>
<b>How exactly digits and precision are related?</b><br>
In general, n number of digits can represent 10^n distinct values.
Hence adding an extra digit will enable us to represent ten times more than the previous. Consider that I measure something to be 2.01 and then later as 2.02
then I am uncertain about the digit at the third decimal place. Having the least count improved from 0.01 to 0.001, I have an extra digit that can represent 10 values in the range between 2.01 and 2.02.
This makes my precision to increase 10 folds. Adding one more digit, will improve the least count to 0.0001 and now I can represent 100 values in the same range which again 10 folds the precision.
As a rule, we can infer that in base m number system, adding an extra m-bit, increases the precision m-folds.<br><br>
This is very interesting in the case of computers, where having one extra bit to represent numbers, increases precision by two times. So extra 1 Byte (8 bits) increases precision by 2^8=256 times.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolf_Landauer" target="_blank">Landauer</a> found that you need a minimum amount of energy to cause thermal fluctuations somewhere in the electronic circuits
to destroy at least one bit of information and as we discussed above it will lead to loss of precision by half.
</p>

<p>
Accuracy is the closeness of agreement between a measured value and a true or accepted value (precise results that most experiments have consistently given).
Measurement error is the amount of inaccuracy and is defined as the difference between the measured value and the ‘true value’ of the thing being measured.
Hence a measurement is only meaningful when we have enough knowledge of the errors and uncertainty involved.
It is possible that people use the words “error” and “uncertainty” interchangeably but error values can be any real number (since it is a difference between two real numbers) and
uncertainty is always a non-negative real number since it is a spread.
</p>

<p>
A measured result agrees with a theoretical prediction if the prediction lies within the range of experimental uncertainty.
If two measured values have standard uncertainty ranges that overlap, then the measurements are said to be consistent (they agree).
If the uncertainty ranges do not overlap, then the measurements are said to be discrepant (they do not agree).
</p>

<p>
Science requires experiments. Experiments give measurements. Recorded measurements are called data. Statistics is the formal science where we develop method for
collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. Probability theory is the mathematical framework for quantifying uncertainty.
Statistics uses probability theory to make statistical inferences. Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions from incomplete, indirect, or uncertain information in any experimental data.
</p>

<p>
<b>Probability - The mathematics of ignorance</b><br>
In probability theory, an experiment is any procedure that yields a well-defined result. A trial is a single execution of the experiment.
The outcome of a trial is the specific result obtained, also called a sample point. The set of all possible outcomes is called the sample space.
An event is a subset of the sample space, consisting of one or more outcomes that satisfy a particular condition of interest.
To quantify the probability of an event say E, denoted as P(E) we can either:<br><br>

1. Run real experiments (frequentist approach) in which the true probability P(E) is the limiting case of empirical probability which is the ratio of the number of times the event E occurs
to the number of trials say N, as the number of trials approaches infinity. It is assumed that each trial doesn’t affect the others and the probability does not change with time.
These assumptions are necessary for convergence and together it is called the law of large numbers.
<br><br>
2. Or construct a probability distribution model (theoretical approach, some may call it Bayesian)
where we define probabilities as fractions going from 0 (certainly not happening) to 1 (certainly happening) for each outcome
(this is the probability distribution function that maps outcomes to a real number in the closed range from 0 to 1)
with the condition that the sum of all these probabilities has to be 1 since the sample space contain all possible outcomes
and it is certain that at least one outcome out of all will happen in any trial.
P(E) now becomes the sum of all the probabilities of outcomes that belong to the subset of event E.
This theoretical approach is verified or tested against the observed probabilities and updated to capture the patterns in an experiment. It is therefore better than the frequentist approach.
Important to note that if an event is certain (only one event in sample space) then we assign the probability as 1 and similarly assign 0 if it is impossible.
But if the probability is 1 that does not imply that the event is certain and similarly probability being 0 does not imply the event being impossible.
Only in a finite, atomic probability space where every outcome has positive probability do probability 1/0 correspond exactly to necessary/impossible events.
</p>

<p>
The best estimate is the expectation value of the probability distribution that models the data.
The uncertainty is the standard deviation of the mean, also called standard error, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements made.
Standard deviation is the square root of variance. Variance is the expectation value of squares of data values minus the square of expectation value of data.
Expectation value of a variable x with probability distribution P(x) is the probability weighted average of all the values of x over the entire sample space.

<b>How does philosophy make progress?</b><br>
Philosophy historically contributed to the formation of systematic human inquiry, including logic, mathematics, ethics, and natural philosophy, from which the sciences later specialized.
Science presupposes philosophy in its very structure:
it relies on logic to reason from evidence, epistemology to justify knowledge claims, metaphysics to assume the existence of a mind-independent reality, and ethics to govern experimentation.
Philosophy is not about what you “believe.” It is about what you can justify under what assumptions.
It does not converge on final answers because many of its questions concern the structure of inquiry itself. Expecting any ultimate answer there is irrational.
Methodology, inference, and interpretation are philosophy applied.
Philosophy progresses by making more precise questions and stronger arguments.
