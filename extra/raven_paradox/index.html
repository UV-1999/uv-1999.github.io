<h1 style="text-align: center;">My Unwarranted Notes on Hempel's Raven Paradox and Peirce's law</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
In my last post, "My Unwarranted Notes of Philosophy," I attempted to define a lot of things that are necessary for any philosophical discourse.
I wrote about a priori and a posteriori propositions.
You may easily remember that a priori propositions are either definitions or deductions, but a posteriori propositions come with the need for observational evidence to justify them.
</p>
<p>
For example, the proposition "420 is an even number" is a synthetic a priori proposition,
and if you know the definitions of "420" and "even number," deducing the truth of the proposition is not very difficult.
Now consider "All ravens are black." The claim is clearly a posteriori and relatively difficult to justify.
</p>
<h2>The Raven Paradox</h2>
<p>
In terms of the properties of being raven and being black colored. Four possible observations are there: 
</p>
<p>
1. Observing a black raven is a direct evidence to confirm "There exists one black raven." But it is only a supporting evidence or example (not an evidential proof) for "All ravens are black".
</p>
<p>
2. Observing a non-black raven is a direct contradictory evidence (counter-example) disproving "All ravens are black".
</p>
<p>
3. Observing a black non-raven entity is an irrelevant evidence since it neither confirm nor contradict "All ravens are black".
</p>
<p>
4. But observing non-black no-raven entities seems to be indirectly supportive of "All ravens are black."
Since via contrapositive reasoning (rule of contraposition) "All ravens are black" is equivalent to "All non-black entities are non-ravens." 
</p>
<p>
To understand how contraposition works, consider that entities are either black or non-black. If all ravens are black then all ravens belong to the set of all black things.
So all non-black entities can not be ravens as there are no non-black ravens. This is how contraposition works.
</p>
<p>
But the observational justification of the contrapositive proposition is intuitively irrelevant. This is the raven paradox.
It asks how can intuitively irrelevant supportive evidence (like a red robbin which is a non-black non-raven) be a logically valid supportive evidence?</p>

<h2>First Half of the Solution</h2>
<p>
If "All ravens are black" is true, then no contradictory evidence (counter-example) can be found.<br>
If "All ravens are black" is false, then contradictory evidence (counter-example) can be found.
</p>
<p>
So instead of searching for evidence or example, one must search for contradictory evidence or counter-example.
The process of searching only for evidence is of limited use since whenever counter-evidence is found, the evidence found no longer holds useful.
One can call it as a falsification approach to this paradox.
</p>
<p>The paradox is only there for "All ravens are black" and similar propositions like "there are no green stars".
Such propositions describe some rule or universality about the property of something.
The paradox is not there for propositions describing particular cases like "This raven is black" or "Some monkeys have red face." Hence there is no need for falsification for particular cases.
Searching for direct evidence suffices for particular cases.
</p>
<p>
But actually, it turns out that falsification is not enough to solve this paradox since the paradox actually arises from the introduction of contrapositive.
But before we resolve it, we must discuss classical and constructive theories of logic.
</p>

<h2>Classical Logic</h2>
<p> 
In the classical zero-order theory logic or propositional logic, propositions are considered as atomic and are either true or false. Combining such atomic propositions,
the resulting compound propositions or logical formula can be of three types:</p>
<p>
1. Tautology - Propositions that are always true irrespective of the truth value of atomic ones that form it.<br><br>
2. Contradictions - Propositions that are always false irrespective of the truth value of atomic ones that form it.<br><br>
3. Contingency - Propositions for which the truth value of atomic ones decide its truth value.
</p>
<p>
In the classical first-order theory of logic (also called predicate logic), a proposition is resolved into subject and predicate. This allows for more expressive power compared to zero-order logic.
The subject is the description of a thing and the predicate is the description of that thing's properties.
A predicate works like a mathematical function that takes in things as variables and gives the truth value of the proposition as the output of the function on a given quantifier.
A quantifier is the description of for how many things the given predicate is true or false.
</p>
<p>
If a predicate P is true for variable (thing) x then the proposition is written as P(x) which means that x has property defined in the predicate P.
</p>
<p>
Consider "All ravens are black" and "Some ravens are black". While it is easy to identify "ravens" as the subject and "are black" as the predicate in the above sentences,
the difference lies in the quantification. Quantification is of two kinds: universal-when we talk about all counts of a thing and existential-when we talk about one or some count of a thing.
Formally the above sentence are stated as "For all ravens, they are black" and "There exists ravens that are black". Well it is a wierd way of writing but it is formal atleast in first order logic.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Universal quantifier</strong> - “for all” (∀) - True when predicate is true for all variables. Here &wedge; represents logical AND. <br>
∀x(P(x)) = P(x<sub>1</sub>) &wedge; P(x<sub>2</sub>) &wedge; P(x<sub>1</sub>) &wedge; ...
</p>
<p>
<strong>Existential quantifier</strong> - “there exists” (∃) - True when predicate is true for at least one variable. Here &or; represents logical OR.<br>
∃x(P(x)) = P(x<sub>1</sub>) &or; P(x<sub>2</sub>) &or; P(x<sub>1</sub>) &or; ...
</p>
<p>
<strong>From De Morgan’s Laws:</strong>
Here &not; is logical NOT.
<br>&not;&exist;x(P(x)) = &forall;x(&not;P(x))
<br>&not;&forall;x(P(x)) = &exist;x(&not;P(x))
</p>
<p>  
A domain is the set of all variables for which the predicate is defined.
A domain is necessary to determine the truth value of any predicate, and a predicate is not defined for variables outside its domain.
One can define second order logic or even beyond by introducing quantification over predicates or over predicates of predicates and so on.
</p>
<p>
In classical logic, the contrapositive "All non-black entities are non-ravens" takes the same truth values as "All ravens are black" therefore evidence for any one the two propositions applies to the another
but classical logic does not take into account relevance based reasoning. 
</p>

<h2>Constructive Logic</h2>
<p>To highlight how the rules of inference in classical logic does not make sense in the different domains consider the following three implications:</p>
<p>
1. If Paris is in France then french people are from France (true implies true).<br>
2. If Paris is in England then english people are from France (false implies false).<br>
3. If Paris is in England then french people are from France (false implies true).<br>
</p>
<p>
The problem here is that the implications are irrelevant despite being valid in classical logic.
There is no connection between the antecedent (the proposition after if and before then) and the consequent (the proposition after then) in any of the above sentences.
Paris being in any country does not prove anything about french or english people.
The properties of the thing "Paris" does not say anything about the properties of french people.
The reason they are irrelevant is that the implication in propositional logic only deals with the truth value of a complete proposition
not the things described in those propositions. This demands a logical theory that takes into account constructve proofs as a necessity to assert any property about a subject.
Contructive logic (also called as intuitionistic logic) is classical logic without the assumption that a propositions is either true or false
but rather the truth value is contingent on evidence or proof.
</p>

<h2>Second Half of The Solution</h2>  
<p>
In contructive logic, the contrapositive is not equivalent to the original assertion because the existence of non-black non-ravens does not imply the existence of black ravens and for that matter even ravens.
Implications like "All ravens are black" first require the proof/evidence that something is a raven then to construct the proof or obtaining evidence that it is black.
The big takeway is that the source of paradox is the error of applying classical logic where contructive logic is more suitable.
</p>

<h2>Bonus - Peirce's law</h2>  
<p>
Peirce's law is a non-trivial tautology in zero-order logic that describes a valid implication but it is semantically not clear.
For propositions P and Q, the laws reads:<br><br>
((P → Q) → P) → P<br><br>
This is infact a tautology which can be varified using a truth table but
my goal is to highlight that while it is valid, it is not meaningful.
</p>

<p>
To understand the validity, we assume that the part (P → Q) → P is true. This demands that either (P → Q) is false or P is true.
If P is true, then we directly reach to the conclusion of Peirce's law but if we consider that (P → Q) is false then either P is false or Q is true.
So if we assume P to be true then surely the conclusion of Peirce's law follows (that P is true) hence it is valid.
</p>

<p>
But to say that (P → Q) → P, means that if "if P then Q" holds then P is true. This is problematic.
When we say "P implies Q" the truth value of P is not inferred but only chosen because "if" does not mean "is".
For example if P is "this apple is red" and Q is "this apple is colored" then (P → Q) is
"If this apple is red then this apple is colored" which is true but this does not imply that the apple is actually red.
This problem is not limited to zero-order logic only but a feature of all classical logic since it is based on the assumption that a proposition is either true or false.
In constructive logic, Peirce's law is not valid because the part (P → Q) → P) does not have a proof since we already showed that it is invalid.
